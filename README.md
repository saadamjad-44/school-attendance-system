## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.14+, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Database**: SQLite (local, no internet required)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt password hashing
- **Reports**: openpyxl for Excel export

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Seed Database (First Run)

```bash
python seed_data.py
```

This creates sample data:
- 1 Admin account
- 1 Principal account
- 5 Teachers (each assigned to a class)
- 8 Classes (6-A, 6-B, 7-A, 7-B, 8-A, 8-B, 9-A, 10-A)
- 160 Students (20 per class)

### 3. Start Server

**Option 1: Using start script (Recommended)**
```bash
# On Windows
start.bat

# On Linux/Mac
bash start.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual start**
```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8001` (or `http://localhost:8000` if available)

### 4. Login

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8001`
